  caveats <<~EOS
    CodexReserve is free and self-signed, so macOS calls it "damaged" on first launch.
    Clear the flag once, then open it normally:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CodexReserve.app
    The source is fully open at https://github.com/yourarnav/CodexReserve if you want to inspect it first.
